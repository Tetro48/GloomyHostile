# Gloomy Hostile addon

Features include:
- Opening a nether portal makes the Moon become eternally new and nighttime eternally gloom.
- Sun being blotted out post-wither (eternal night, but not gloom for 10m)
- Optionally enable this for all difficulties, not just Hostile.
  - Don't turn this on if you're not sure if you wanted that.
- Defeating the Ender Dragon (technically, entering The End) will return the world back to normal.
  - This functionality can be turned off, for the darkness to remain.

You can optionally challenge yourself with World Challenge Level configuration.
