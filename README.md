# Gloomy Hostile addon

Features include:
- Night time always being gloom post-nether
- Sun being blotted out post-wither (eternal night, but not gloom for 10m)
- Optionally enable this for all difficulties, not just Hostile.
  - Don't turn this on if you're not sure you wanted that.
- Defeating the Ender Dragon (technically, entering The End) will turn this off.
  - This functionality can be turned off, for the darkness to remain.
